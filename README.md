# celestepad
so... i play the game celeste a little bit, and thought it'd be cool to have a macropad with the bindings i use! (the defaults... haha)

![the whole pad](https://github.com/mynameisashllee/celestepad/blob/main/images/celestepad.png?raw=true)

## features
- celestepad uses 7 keys (climb [z], dash [x], jump [c] and arrow keys)
- regular ol case

how the case looks alone:

## bom
7x Cherry MX Switches<br>
7x DSA Keycaps<br>
7x Heatset Inserts<br>
7x Bolts<br>
1x XIAO RP2040<br>
1x Case (with 2 printed parts)<br>

## extras
this is my first time doing hardware! making a pcb! 3d modelling! had to google a lot but it was worth it (:
if i have time later on, i'll try and make a cute strawberry case that can open up to show the macropad. maybe with hinges? we'll see!
