# celestepad
so... i play the game celeste a little bit, and thought it'd be cool to have a macropad with the bindings i use! (the defaults... haha)

check out the demo on [reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/celestegame/comments/1mbj6k7/i_made_a_mini_keypad_to_play_celeste/)

## features
- celestepad uses 7 keys (climb [z], dash [x], jump [c] and arrow keys. yes, they look inconveniently placed but they work pretty fine)
- regular ol case (enhanced with air dry clay and craft skills)

here's how it looks with just the circuit board and 3d print:

here's how the case looks alone:

## bom
- 7x cherry MX switches
- 7x DSA keycaps
- 4x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts
- 4x M3x16mm screws
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x case (with 2 printed parts)
- some air dry clay, paint, hot glue and felt

## extras
this is my first time doing hardware! making a pcb! 3d modelling! had to google a lot but it was worth it (:
if i have time later on, i'll try and make a cute strawberry case that can open up to show the macropad. maybe with hinges? we'll see!

update: i ended up using air dry clay for fun and i'm really happy with the crafty look it's got!
